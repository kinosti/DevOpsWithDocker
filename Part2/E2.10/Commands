By using "docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost", we get:

----
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0000030s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp  filtered http
111/tcp open     rpcbind

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.45 seconds
----

We see that the ports 5000 and 8080 are no longer directly accessible in the host network, so all is OK.
