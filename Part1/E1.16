I made E1.14 updated backend into a containerized web-service hosted on Render.io.

I first created a new (public) repo at Docker Hub "djalok/updated-backend". Then the commands in CMD:

>docker build . -t backend-updated
>docker run -p 8080:8080 backend-updated
>docker tag backend-updated djalok/backend-updated
>docker push djalok/backend-updated

After this I logged into render.io --> new --> web service and selected "Deploy an existing image from registry",
I then gave the Image URL as docker.io/djalok/backend-updated:latest (as omitting the versiontag in CMD earlier defaulted to tag "latest").
As the Image repo was public, no credentials were needed. I then selected a proper name and closest server for the service and selected the free host version --> "Create Web Service".

Access the web-service at https://backend-updated-82ll.onrender.com/ping (only returns "pong" to accessing the site /ping).
